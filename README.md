# Python 3 Working Group


The purpose of this Working Group is to ease the transition from Python 2 to Python 3
for Academy Software Foundation (ASWF) projects and ASWF members' internal codebases.
We hope to achieve this by coordinating key milestones in the VFX industry's transition
and facilitating the sharing of expertise between ASWF members.


The goals of the Working Group are the distinct outcomes that are to be anticipated
from the Working Group. They are as follows:


* Share and develop best practices for transitioning to Python 3.
* Coordinate transition efforts between software developers and vendors.
* Articulate and share common experiences to avoid duplicate efforts.


The non-goals of the Working Group are
areas that the Working Group are intentionally choosing not to address.
They are as follows:


* To provide engineering resources for helping projects transition to Python 3.
* To provide engineering resources for unblocking ASFW membersâ€™ transition efforts,
although sharing and highlighting blockers may be an important part of coordinating transition efforts.


The TAC member sponsor of this working group is Daniel Heckenberg.


## Deliverables


* Regular updates to the VES committee list of VFX packages and applications that support Python 3.
This includes packages that are used frequently in VFX and do not already have Python 3 support.
* A document that collates best practices and advice to consider when transitioning to Python 3,
not necessarily specific to Python 3.
* A collection of common problems and their respective solutions found when transitioning to Python 3.
* A regularly maintained list of risk factors to the VFX industry in its timely transition to Python 3.
