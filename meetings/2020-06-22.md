# 22nd June 2020

## Agenda

* Previous action items:
   * Further comments on the draft README.
* Election of a permanent chair
* How do we get vendors involved?
* (Ashley) Creation of deliverables
   * Start the documents and our additions may spark discussions for these meetings?
   * How to manage them? Discuss in PR but larger discussion can happen in these meetings?
* What is currently blocking everyone from progressing? What blockers are upcoming and when?
* (Ashley) Format of future meetings
   * If we don't have enough agenda items for a meeting,
     we could discuss how each of us are planning to transition to Python 3.
     So one VFX house would have something prepared for the next meeting,
     and we round robin.
