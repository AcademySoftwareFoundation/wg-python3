## Meeting Notes
* Robert
  * Production Version of Python3 for Houdini
  * Late 3rd/ Early 4th Quarter
  * Python2 will still be available for the next release.
  * Still keeping it open for the 2021 release will probably still have python2+3
  * builds, depending on industry adoption.
  * eg. Houdini19 (this year) and Houdini20 (next year) will likely both 2+3.
  * Houdini19 for sure.
  * Houdini20 TBD on industry uptake.

* Ollie
  * Vendors may or may not be so generous
  * Python2 support removed in Maya2022 per Autodesk
  * Isotropix as well.
  * Shows will defer as much as possible.

* Ryan
  * Conversion will never get done when left up to show timelines.

* Ollie
  * Vendor that locks down first delivers an ultimatum to production.

* Ashley
  * Engineers need to convince the studios that we need to spend our time
    moving to python3 to get new versions of DCCs
  * Python3 will not be important to shows until Python2 goes away.

* Robert
  * We would love to drop python2, but industry will drive the needs.
  * Python3 SIGGRAPH?
  * VFX Reference Platform BOF
  * ASWF Open Source, Python3 will be discussed
  * Python3.8 likely will be the version in the next platform release.

* Mark
  * Python 3.8 has a new compatibility feature to allow broader compatibility
    between python3 versions.  Headers look for a special define and exclude
    struct details to define a minimal ABI for compatibility.
