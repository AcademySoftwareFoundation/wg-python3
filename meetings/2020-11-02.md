# Notes
* Alex Wilke new attendee from Animal Logic, welcome!
* Wanting to find list of what's going away in Python 3.9.
  * JT will add to repo notes.
* No new blockers for Python 3
* PySide2 / PyQt / Qt 5.12 crashes on exit -- Ashley brought this up w/ PySide2.
  * David -- yes, we have seen PyQt and pure-Qt apps crashing on exit in 5.12.
  * Possible cause is latent application code that relied on incorrect
    semantics, and newer versions of Qt are being more strict/"correct" in how
    they handle widget destruction.

  * https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-63945 (interesting notes, maybe not related)
* Python Guidelines.  We'll discuss items, drop style notes, and look at
  migrating them to the best practices document.

* Python3 Document
  * Note about implicit namespaces should be included.
  * shebang lines -- usually only using "python" in shebang lines.
    "python" still being used to imply python2+3 compatible.
    "If you only have environments that are a single version of Python then
     always use `python`.  Only if you have a single version of Python (3)
     then should the shebang line say `python3`".
  * Absolute imports -- downside is having to remove the `__future__`
    statements in the future.  We should include.
  * Should call out futurize and python3 conservative porting guide as
    reference documents.
